## [Wilbur and Array](https://vjudge.net/problem/CodeForces-596B)


Wilbur the pig is tinkering with arrays again. He has the array  *a* <sub>1</sub>, *a* <sub>2</sub>, ..., *a* <sub> *n*</sub> initially consisting of  *n* zeros. At one step, he can choose any index  *i* and either add 1 to all elements  *a* <sub> *i*</sub>, *a* <sub> *i* + 1</sub>, ... , *a* <sub> *n*</sub> or subtract 1 from all elements  *a* <sub> *i*</sub>, *a* <sub> *i* + 1</sub>, ..., *a* <sub> *n*</sub>. His goal is to end up with the array  *b* <sub>1</sub>, *b* <sub>2</sub>, ..., *b* <sub> *n*</sub>. 

Of course, Wilbur wants to achieve this goal in the minimum number of steps and asks you to compute this value.

### Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer  *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 200 000) — the length of the array  *a* <sub> *i*</sub>. Initially  *a* <sub> *i*</sub> = 0 for every position  *i*, so this array is not given in the input.

The second line of the input contains  *n* integers  *b* <sub>1</sub>, *b* <sub>2</sub>, ..., *b* <sub> *n*</sub> ( - 10<sup>9</sup> ≤ *b* <sub> *i*</sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>).

### Output

Print the minimum number of steps that Wilbur needs to make in order to achieve  *a* <sub> *i*</sub> = *b* <sub> *i*</sub> for all  *i*.

### Examples

**Input**

**Input**

4
1 2 2 1


**Output**

### Note

In the first sample, Wilbur may successively choose indices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and add 1 to corresponding suffixes.

In the second sample, Wilbur first chooses indices 1 and 2 and adds 1 to corresponding suffixes, then he chooses index 4 and subtract 1.

## [Xortest Path](https://vjudge.net/problem/CodeChef-XORPATH)


Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCKFL16/mandarin/XORPATH.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCKFL16/russian/XORPATH.pdf) and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCKFL16/vietnamese/XORPATH.pdf) as well.

Chef was practicing with some graph theory problems in CodeChef. He was trying to solve a problem involving finding the **shortest path** in a weighted, undirected graph. He thought it was quite standard, so he coded the solution and submitted it. Unfortunately it was judged “Wrong Answer”.

Wanting to debug, Chef downloaded Peter Xor's accepted solution. He also made a test case, illustrated by the following image:

![](https://vj.z180.cn/763dc6145890292ad464ba16896cba61?v=1594207747)

Now, what is the cost of the shortest path from 1 to 5? Chef thought that the answer should be **36 + 16 + 18 = 70**, because the other candidate path has a higher total cost of **36 + 50 + 11 + 18 = 115**. But he was surprised when Peter Xor's accepted solution outputted **15**! Chef was confused because he can't see any path with a total cost of **15**.

After rereading the problem, Chef found his mistake. The problem's title was actually **Xortest path**, not **Shortest path**, so the problem was actually asking for the path between two given nodes with **the least possible XOR**! So in the example above, the answer is indeed **15**, because the path **1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5** has an XOR cost of **36 ⊕ 50 ⊕ 11 ⊕ 18 = 15**, and no other path has a lower XOR cost than this. In other words, this is the “xortest path”.

Now that Chef knows his mistake, he still has a problem; he doesn't know how to answer this problem! Your task as his sous-chef is to answer this problem for him. Specifically, you have to answer **Q** queries, where each query is a pair of nodes, and the answer is the weight of the “xortest path” between them.

Note that in this problem, a **path** may pass through an edge or node any number of times. (Some authors would call such a path a **walk**.) For instance, in the example above, the path **1 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 4 → 5** is also a “xortest path”, because its XOR cost is **36 ⊕ 16 ⊕ 11 ⊕ 50 ⊕ 16 ⊕ 18 = 15**.

### Input

The first line of input contains three integers, **N**, **E** and **Q**. Nodes are labelled **1** to **N**.

The following **E** lines describe the edges. The **i<sup>th</sup>** line contains three integers **a<sub>i</sub>**, **b<sub>i</sub>** and **c<sub>i</sub>**, which means that there is an undirected edge between nodes **a<sub>i</sub>** and **b<sub>i</sub>** with weight **c<sub>i</sub>**.

The following **Q** lines describe the queries. The **j<sup>th</sup>** line contains two integers **x<sub>j</sub>** and **y<sub>j</sub>**, which means that you need to find the “xortest path” between nodes **x<sub>j</sub>** and **y<sub>j</sub>**.

### Output

Output **Q** lines, one for each query. The **j<sup>th</sup>** line must contain a single integer, the weight of the xortest path between **x<sub>j</sub>** and **y<sub>j</sub>**. If there does not exist a path between these nodes, output “XIT” (without quotes) instead.

### Constraints

- **1** ≤ **N**, **E**, **Q** ≤ **10<sup>5</sup>**
- **1** ≤ **a<sub>i</sub>**, **b<sub>i</sub>**, **x<sub>j</sub>**, **y<sub>j</sub>** ≤ **N**
- **0** ≤ **c<sub>i</sub>** ≤ **10<sup>9</sup>**
- Parallel edges or self-loops may appear.

**Input:**
7 7 5

## [Archmage](https://vjudge.net/problem/Gym-102623A)


Archmage (AM for short) is a hero unit in WatercraftⅢ.

He has $n$ mana at most and two powerful skills which enable him to show great strength in battle:

1.  Use $x$ mana to summon a Water Element. 
1.  Brilliance Aura restores $y$ mana for AM in a second, and it is the only way to restore mana. Since his mana cannot exceed the upper limit, the superfluous mana will dissipate. i.e., suppose you have $p$ mana before the restoration, your mana will become $\min(p+y,n)$. 

Since the power of an Archmage is tremendous, the upper limit of mana $n$ is always greater than or equal to $x+y$.

Every second, Archmage will summon exactly one Water Element (if the mana is enough, i.e., his mana won't be less than $0$ after that) or do nothing. Then no matter what he did before, he will restore $y$ mana.

Archmage has $n$ mana at the end of the second $0$, and the game starts at the beginning of the second $1$.

He wants to know how many Water Elements he can summon at most before the end of the second $m$.

### Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. 

The first line contains a single integer $t(1 \leq t \leq 10^5)$, indicating the number of test cases.

Each of the next $t$ lines contains $4$ integers $n,m,x,y(1 \leq m,x,y \leq 10^9,x+y \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9)$.

### Output

For each test case, output the answer in a line.

### Example

**Input**

3
2 2 1 1
4 4 2 1
6 10 4 2


**Output**

2
3
6


### Note

In test case $1$, Archmage can cast spells every second, so the answer is $2$.

In test case $2$, here's a way for Archmage to cast spells $3$ times.

Second $1$: Archmage cast spells, and there is $4-x+y=3$ mana left.

Second $2$: Archmage cast spells, and there is $3-x+y=2$ mana left.

Second $3$: Archmage cast spells, and there is $2-x+y=1$ mana left.

Second $4$: Archmage doesn't have enough mana so he can do nothing, and there is $1+y=2$ mana left.

## [Day at the Beach](https://vjudge.net/problem/CodeForces-599C)


One day Squidward, Spongebob and Patrick decided to go to the beach. Unfortunately, the weather was bad, so the friends were unable to ride waves. However, they decided to spent their time building sand castles.

At the end of the day there were  *n* castles built by friends. Castles are numbered from 1 to  *n*, and the height of the  *i*-th castle is equal to  *h* <sub> *i*</sub>. When friends were about to leave, Squidward noticed, that castles are not ordered by their height, and this looks ugly. Now friends are going to reorder the castles in a way to obtain that condition  *h* <sub> *i*</sub> ≤ *h* <sub> *i* + 1</sub> holds for all  *i* from 1 to  *n* - 1.

Squidward suggested the following process of sorting castles: 

-  Castles are split into blocks — groups of consecutive castles. Therefore the block from  *i* to  *j* will include castles  *i*, *i* + 1, ..., *j*. A block may consist of a single castle. 
-  The partitioning is chosen in such a way that every castle is a part of exactly one block. 
-  Each block is sorted independently from other blocks, that is the sequence  *h* <sub> *i*</sub>, *h* <sub> *i* + 1</sub>, ..., *h* <sub> *j*</sub> becomes sorted. 
-  The partitioning should satisfy the condition that after each block is sorted, the sequence  *h* <sub> *i*</sub> becomes sorted too. This may always be achieved by saying that the whole sequence is a single block. 

Even Patrick understands that increasing the number of blocks in partitioning will ease the sorting process. Now friends ask you to count the maximum possible number of blocks in a partitioning that satisfies all the above requirements.

### Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer  *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 100 000) — the number of castles Spongebob, Patrick and Squidward made from sand during the day.

The next line contains  *n* integers  *h* <sub> *i*</sub> (1 ≤ *h* <sub> *i*</sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>). The  *i*-th of these integers corresponds to the height of the  *i*-th castle.

### Output

Print the maximum possible number of blocks in a valid partitioning.

### Examples

**Input**

3
1 2 3


**Output**

3


**Input**

4
2 1 3 2


**Output**

2


### Note

In the first sample the partitioning looks like that: [1][2][3].

In the second sample the partitioning is: [2, 1][3, 2]

## [Bear and Tree Jumps](https://vjudge.net/problem/CodeForces-771C)


A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles. The distance between two vertices is the number of edges in a simple path between them.

Limak is a little polar bear. He lives in a tree that consists of  *n* vertices, numbered 1 through  *n*.

Limak recently learned how to jump. He can jump from a vertex to any vertex within distance at most  *k*.

For a pair of vertices (*s*, *t*) we define  *f*(*s*, *t*) as the minimum number of jumps Limak needs to get from  *s* to  *t*. Your task is to find the sum of  *f*(*s*, *t*) over all pairs of vertices (*s*, *t*) such that  *s* &lt; *t*.

### Input

The first line of the input contains two integers  *n* and  *k* (2 ≤ *n* ≤ 200 000, 1 ≤ *k* ≤ 5) — the number of vertices in the tree and the maximum allowed jump distance respectively.

The next  *n* - 1 lines describe edges in the tree. The  *i*-th of those lines contains two integers  *a* <sub> *i*</sub> and  *b* <sub> *i*</sub> (1 ≤ *a* <sub> *i*</sub>, *b* <sub> *i*</sub> ≤ *n*) — the indices on vertices connected with  *i*-th edge.

It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

### Output

Print one integer, denoting the sum of  *f*(*s*, *t*) over all pairs of vertices (*s*, *t*) such that  *s* &lt; *t*.

**Output**

### Note

In the first sample, the given tree has 6 vertices and it's displayed on the drawing below. Limak can jump to any vertex within distance at most 2. For example, from the vertex 5 he can jump to any of vertices: 1, 2 and 4 (well, he can also jump to the vertex 5 itself).

There are ![](https://vj.z180.cn/cb376bb0689ae194ed08378267da69ff?v=1593861998) pairs of vertices (*s*, *t*) such that  *s* &lt; *t*. For 5 of those pairs Limak would need two jumps: (1, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 6). For other 10 pairs one jump is enough. So, the answer is 5·2 + 10·1 = 20.

In the third sample, Limak can jump between every two vertices directly. There are 3 pairs of vertices (*s* &lt; *t*), so the answer is 3·1 = 3.

## [MITE](https://vjudge.net/problem/Gym-102623M)


Setsuna is playing a computer game called MITE (MogicianCraft Is Too Easy).

In this game, sugar cane is a valuable plant for crafting rockets and trading paper.

Setsuna has a farm. To be a Farm Tycoon, she wants to plant some sugar cane on the land.

The farm can be seen as a two-dimensional plane composed of $n \times m$ blocks, and the size of each block is exactly $1 \times 1$.

There are four types of blocks: sand block, sand block with sugar cane, rock block and water block.

At the beginning, there are only sand blocks and rock blocks. But, Setsuna can replace sand blocks with water blocks, and she can do this any number of times.

To plant sugar cane on a block, Setsuna should follow these rules:

1.  Sugar cane can only be planted on sand blocks on the farm. 
1.  The sand block sugar cane planted on must be adjacent to at least one water block. Two blocks are considered adjacent if and only if they share an edge. 

Setsuna wants to know how to maximize the number of blocks that sugar cane can be planted on.

### Input

The first line of the input contains two integers $n,m(1 \leq n \leq 30,1 \leq m \leq 8)$.

The next $n$ lines contains $m$ characters each, where the $j$-th character of the $i$-th line is $b_{i,j}$ ($b_{i,j}$ is either '.' if the block $(i,j)$ is a sand block or '#' if the block $(i,j)$ is a rock block).

### Output

Print $n$ lines, each of which contains $m$ characters, where the $j$-th character of the $i$-th line is $c_{i,j}$. 

$c_{i,j}$ indicates the type of the block $(i,j)$ after reforming.

If the block $(i,j)$ is a water block, $c_{i,j}$ should be 'O'.

If the block $(i,j)$ is a sand block with sugar cane, $c_{i,j}$ should be 'X'.

If the block $(i,j)$ is just a sand block, $c_{i,j}$ should be '.'.

If the block $(i,j)$ is a rock block, $c_{i,j}$ should be '#'.

You should make sure the number of 'X' is maximal. If there are multiple solutions, print any.

## [A Game of Balls](https://vjudge.net/problem/CodeChef-GAMEBALL)


### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCKPA17/mandarin/GAMEBALL.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCKPA17/russian/GAMEBALL.pdf) and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCKPA17/vietnamese/GAMEBALL.pdf) as well.

You are playing a game of balls on a grid of dimensions **n * m**. All except one cell in this grid contains a ball each, i.e. exactly one of the cells is empty, and the others contain exactly 1 ball. You are allowed to make one of the following two kind of moves one by one in any order:




- Choose two adjacent cells one containing a ball and other being empty. Move the ball to the empty cell. Two cells are said to be adjacent to each other if they share a side with each other.
- Choose three consecutive cells (either horizontal or vertical), in which the middle cell has a ball, one of the other cells has a ball and the remaining one is empty. You can move the ball from the non-empty non-middle cell to the empty cell, and destroy the ball in the middle cell while jumping over it, thus making middle cell empty too.



You are asked to play this game. At the end of the game, you win if there is exactly one cell containing a ball. You can make at max 5000 moves per testcase. Find any possible sequence of moves to win this game. If this is impossible to achieve, print -1.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. The description of **T** test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers, **n, m** which are the dimensions of the grid.

The i-th of the next **n** lines contains **m** characters. denoting the i-th row of the grid. The character '.' denotes that cell is empty, whereas '*' denotes that the cell has a ball in it.

### Output

For each test case, the first line should contain an integer X which will denote the number of moves you want to make. If it is impossible to achieve the desired objective, this integer should be -1. This number X should be at most 5000.

If it is possible to achieve the objective, then each of the next X lines should contain four space separated integers: x1, y1, x2, y2 which signifies the following.
If you are making the first type of move, then you are moving the ball from the cell (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).
In the second type of move, it will denote that the non-middle cell with ball is (x1, y1) and the empty cell is (x2, y2).

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ **T** ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ **n, m** ≤ 10

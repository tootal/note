1.共享单车出现。2016年共享单车元年，解决最后一公里难题、新四大发明之一、低碳环保的出行方式。
2.带来的问题。资本涌入，大量共享单车无序摆放影响交通。
**3.原因。盈利模式不清晰、供过于求，过度投放，冲击实体经济，人为破坏。**
4.未来发展。（我认为共享单车不会灭亡，随着人们素质的提高，行业回归理性，盈利方式的多元化，最终会持续发展下去）


为何共享单车造成这些问题？
1. 盲目扩张

相关数据显示，2017年中国共享单车全行业累计投放单车2300万辆、覆盖200个城市。人们现在提到共享单车，第一反应已经不再是服务人们的“新四大发明之一”，而是“城市的蝗虫”。盲目扩张带来的后果，就是导致很多单车停放在路上并没有被利用，而这些多余的单车，给城市正常的交通秩序带来干扰。

2.盈利模式
共享单车企业在发展过程中，一直没有明确的盈利方式。一直到现在，共享单车企业都还在依靠用户的押金和广告费来盈利，这显然是无法持续盈利的。目前Ofo公司共享单车排队退押金的人已经超过一千万。有知情人士表示，多数单车企业都没有采用第三方存管方式，且存在着为保持现金流而挪用押金的现象。如今虽然共享单车企业只剩下ofo和摩拜公司，但是它们仍然在不断亏损。


3.人民素质
共享单车的飞速发展，同时也冲击了一些自行车零售业和维修业，许多人选择更便宜的共享单车而不去购买单车，这造成了卖自行车的商人收益减少。许多素质低下的人就暗中损坏自行车，使得共享单车无法骑行。更有一些人为了独占共享单车而私自上锁，让他人无法骑走。这些都是不道德的行为。

Why do sharing bikes cause these problems?
Blind expansion

Relevant data show that in 2017, China's shared bicycle industry has placed a total of 23 million bicycles and covered 200 cities. People now mention sharing bicycles. The first reaction is no longer one of the "new four major inventions" for serving people, but "the city's locusts." The consequence of blind expansion is that many bicycles are parked on the road and are not used, and these extra bicycles interfere with the normal traffic order of the city.

2. Profit model
In the development process of shared bicycle companies, there has been no clear way of profit. Until now, shared bicycle companies are still relying on user deposits and advertising fees to make a profit, which is obviously not sustainable. At present, Ofo has more than 10 million people sharing bicycles to refund the deposit. Some people familiar with the matter said that most bicycle companies did not use third-party depository methods, and there was a phenomenon of misappropriation of deposits to maintain cash flow. Today, although shared bicycle companies only have ofof and Mobai companies, they are still losing money.

3. People's quality
The rapid development of shared bicycles has also hit some bicycle retail and maintenance industries. Many people choose cheaper shared bicycles instead of buying bicycles, which has reduced the income of businessmen who sell bicycles. Many people with low quality secretly damage the bicycle, making it impossible for the shared bicycle to ride. Some people are locked in order to monopolize the sharing of bicycles, so that others can not ride. These are all unethical behaviors.




3. Quality of the people

The rapid development of bicycle sharing has also impacted some bicycle retailing and maintenance industries. Many people choose to share bicycles cheaper rather than buy bicycles, which has resulted in a decrease in the profits of bicycle sellers. Many low-quality people secretly damage bicycles, making sharing bicycles impossible to ride. Some people lock their bicycles privately in order to monopolize sharing bicycles, so that others can not ride them. These are immoral acts.

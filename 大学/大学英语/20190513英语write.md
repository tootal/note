When I was a child, I was infected with rheumatic fever. The family doctor fell ill and came to our house with his black medical kit and stayed with me all night.
Today, doctors no longer call, and they are not free to do what they think the patient needs. Instead, they paid for the medical insurance. Thousands of non-medical Medicare employees are responsible for overseeing this process.
The direct admission of doctors began 30 years ago and is becoming more and more popular. But doctors are developing new payment methods. Another way to reduce costs is to save costs. When doctors do not have the fees associated with insurance billing, they pass the savings on to the patient.
It takes time to restore traditional doctor-patient relationships, but don't make mistakes: patient care changes. Finally, welcome changes.

在现代社会，城市交通问题变得越来越严重. 随着城市人口的增多和汽车的增加，城市交通问题日益突出。在许多大城市，由于过量的汽车，经常导致交通阻塞，交通事故频繁，大气遭到污染等。交通问题已经给城市社会经济发展带来了严重影响。
1.交通阻塞　　相对于道路网的承载力来说，汽车数量过多，诱发了交通阻塞问题。　　2.交通事故,交通事故是许多大城市存在的日趋严重的问题。3.在发展中国家，则使公共交通高峰时间的拥挤现象更为严重，从而加剧了城市交通问题。
要解决拥堵问题，必须从几方面着手：靠合理的规划和大力建设，提高道路和交通设施的能力；采用科学有效的手段，如采用智能交通系统，提高运输和通行效率，让每个开车、坐车的人都能随时随地得到交通信息；加强交通管理，解决秩序问题.

In modern society, urban traffic problems have become more and more serious. With the increase of urban population and the increase of automobiles, urban traffic problems have become increasingly prominent. In many large cities, due to excessive vehicles, traffic jams, traffic accidents, and atmospheric pollution are often caused. Traffic problems have already had a serious impact on the city's social and economic development.
1. Traffic congestion Relative to the carrying capacity of the road network, the number of cars is too large, causing traffic congestion problems. 2. Traffic accidents and traffic accidents are increasingly serious problems in many large cities. 3. In developing countries, the congestion of public transportation during peak hours is more serious, thus exacerbating urban traffic problems.
To solve the congestion problem, we must start from several aspects: improve the capacity of roads and transportation facilities by reasonable planning and vigorous construction; adopt scientific and effective means, such as the use of intelligent transportation systems, improve transportation and traffic efficiency, and let each drive, People who are in the car can get traffic information anytime and anywhere; strengthen traffic management and solve order problems.

我认为运动会是人们更加团结而不是分离.主要有如下几点原因:
第一 竞技运动有许多集体项目如篮球,足球,排球,它们都需要团结才能获得胜利。
第二 运动可以促进各国的民间交流。在比赛中,人与人之间能够更好的沟通与了解.例如我国在2008年成功举办奥运会,增强了人们的凝聚力.
第三 运动的宗旨就是团结,在运动员的背后还有教练,医生以及许许多多的人.它们都因为运动团结在一起.我想,没有这些志愿者的无私奉献,运动员是无法取得好成绩的.

I think that sports games are more united than separation. There are several reasons for this:
The first competitive sport has many collective projects such as basketball, football, and volleyball, all of which need to be united to win.
The second movement can promote civil exchanges in various countries. In the competition, people can communicate and understand better. For example, China successfully hosted the Olympic Games in 2008, which enhanced people's cohesiveness.
The purpose of the third movement is unity. There are coaches, doctors and many people behind the athletes. They are all united by sports. I think that without the selfless dedication of these volunteers, athletes can't get good results.

题目：[1381972] unit 6
要求

College Students are doing less and less literature reading these days. what do you think are the reasons for this? what can be done to effectively encourage them to read more of literature works?

大学生，理应是一个社会中认知最鲜活、精力最旺盛、行动最自由的群体，站在浪尖上的他们读什么书，往往能引领一个时代的阅读风向。如果将历代大学生手中的书籍串联起来，那就会构成中国青年思想变迁的一个侧面。今日的年轻人蓦然回首，其实不难发现，我们和前辈所读的书，已经相去甚远。
许多学生参加了学校的杂志社编辑部，所以要写各种策划书、宣传稿，还有编辑微信等各种事物，平时比较忙。再加上自己比较随意，不会合理安排时间导每天阅读时间不多。  手机免费阅读成为大学生主要阅读方式，是信息时代的来临对传统阅读挑战的结果，是时代发展的产物。  

大学生应该根据自己的兴趣爱好、成长需要，有目的地去阅读一些书籍，“这样就在有限的时间去阅读更多的书，获取更多的知识。”

College students should be the most vivid, energetic and free-moving group in a society. What books they read on the wave can often lead the reading trend of an era. If the books in the hands of college students are connected in series, it will constitute a side of the changes in Chinese youth thinking. Today's young people look back, but it is not difficult to find that we have a far cry from the books that our predecessors read.
Many students have participated in the editorial department of the school's magazines, so they have to write various planning books, publicity papers, and edit WeChat and other things, usually busy. In addition, I am more casual, and I will not arrange the time to guide me to read less time per day. The free reading of mobile phones has become the main reading method for college students. It is the result of the coming of the information age and the challenge of traditional reading. It is the product of the development of the times.

Undergraduate students should read some books according to their hobbies and needs, and “go read more books and gain more knowledge in a limited time.”

近年来，太空旅游吸引了越来越多的公众关注。 一些大公司甚至表示有兴趣在太空建造酒店。 然而，有些人认为建造太空酒店只是浪费时间和金钱。

太空旅行是基于人们遨游太空的理想，到太空去旅游，给人提供一种前所未有的体验，最新奇和最为刺激人的是可以观赏太空旖旎的风光，同时还可以享受失重的味道。而这两种体验只有太空中才能享受到，可以说，此景只有天上有。
太空游项目始于2001年4月30日。一些商业太空探险公司，如Elon Musk建立的SpaceX公司、荷兰SXC（Space Expedition Corporation）太空旅行公司、理查德·布兰森建立的维珍银河太空探险公司，致力于降低太空旅行的价格，实现普通人的太空旅行之梦。

我认为探索太空并不是浪费时间和金钱,它不仅可以让我们更好的了解这个世界和宇宙,还为我们带来了很多实际利益.比如我们日常生活中使用的导航技术,就是通过导航卫星发送的信号来定位的.太空旅游势必会带动太空技术的发展,而太空技术的发展将更好的服务于人类.

Space travel is based on the ideal of people traveling in space. Traveling to space provides an unprecedented experience. The latest and most exciting thing is to enjoy the scenery of space and enjoy the taste of weightlessness. These two experiences can only be enjoyed in space. It can be said that this scene is only available in heaven.
The space tour project began on April 30, 2001. Some commercial space exploration companies, such as SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, Space Exedition Corporation of the Netherlands, and Virgin Galactic Space Exploration, founded by Richard Branson, are committed to reducing the price of space travel. Ordinary people's dream of space travel.

I think that exploring space is not a waste of time and money. It not only allows us to better understand the world and the universe, but also brings us many practical benefits. For example, the navigation technology used in our daily life is sent via navigation satellites. The signal to locate. Space tourism is bound to drive the development of space technology, and the development of space technology will better serve humanity.
